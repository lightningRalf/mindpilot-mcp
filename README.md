See through your agent's eyes. Visualize legacy code, inspect complex flows, understand everything.

## Why Mindpilot?
- **Visualize Anything**: Use your coding agent to generate on-demand architecture, code, and process diagrams to view your code from different perspectives.
- **Vibe Checks**: AI-generated code can accumulate unused and redundant constructs. Use visualizations to spot areas that need cleanup.
- **Local Processing**: Diagrams are never sent to the cloud. Everything stays between you, your agent, and your agent's LLM provider(s).
- **Export & Share**: Export any diagram as a vector image.

## Prerequisites

Node.js v20.0.0 or higher.

## Quickstart

### Claude Code
`claude mcp add mindpilot -- npx @mindpilot/mcp@latest`

### Cursor
Under `Settings` > `Cursor Settings` > `MCP` > Click `Add new global MCP server` and configure mindpilot in the `mcpServers` object.

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mindpilot": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@mindpilot/mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

### VS Code
Follow the instructions here for enabling MCPs in VS Code:  https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers

Go to `Settings` > `Features` > `MCP`, then click `Edit in settings json`

Then add mindpilot to your MCP configuration:

```
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "mindpilot": {
        "type": "stdio",
        "command": "npx",
        "args": ["@mindpilot/mcp@latest"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Windsurf

Under `Settings` > `Windsurf Settings` > `Manage Plugins`, click `view raw config` and configure mindpilot in the `mcpServers` object:

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mindpilot": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@mindpilot/mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Zed
In the AI Thread panel click on the three dots `...`, then click `Add Custom Server...`

In the `Command to run MCPserver` field enter `npx @mindpilot/mcp@latest` and click `Add Server`.

## Configuration Options
- **Port**: The server defaults to port 4000 but can be configured using the `--port` command line switch.
- **Data Path**: By default, diagrams are saved to `~/.mindpilot/data/`. You can specify a custom location using the `--data-path` command line switch.

## Multi-Client Support

Mindpilot intelligently handles multiple AI assistants running simultaneously. When you have multiple Claude Desktop windows or IDE instances open:

- The first assistant to use Mindpilot starts a shared web server
- Additional assistants automatically connect to the existing server
- All assistants share the same diagram history and web interface
- The server automatically shuts down a minute after the last assistant disconnects

This means you can work with multiple AI assistants at once without port conflicts, and they'll all contribute to the same collection of diagrams.

## Anonymous Usage Tracking

Mindpilot MCP collects anonymous usage data to help us understand how the product is being used and improve the user experience.

### Disabling Analytics
If you prefer not to share anonymous usage data, you can disable analytics by adding the `--disable-analytics` flag to your MCP configuration:

**Claude Code:**
```bash
claude mcp add mindpilot -- npx @mindpilot/mcp@latest --disable-analytics
```

**Other IDEs:**
Add `"--disable-analytics"` to the args array in your configuration:
```json
{
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["@mindpilot/mcp@latest", "--disable-analytics"]
}
```

## Using the MCP server
After configuring the MCP in your coding agent you can make requests like "create a diagram about x" and it should use the MCP server to render Mermaid diagrams for you in a browser connected to the MCP server.

You can optionally update your agent's rules file to give specific instructions about when to use mindpilot-mcp.

### Example requests
- "Show me the state machine for WebSocket connection logic"
- "Create a C4 context diagram of this project's architecture."
- "Show me the OAuth flow as a sequence diagram"

## How it works
Frontier LLMs are well trained to generate valid Mermaid syntax. The MCP is designed to accept Mermaid syntax and render diagrams in a web app running on http://localhost:4000 (default port).

## Troubleshooting

### Port Conflicts
If you use port 4000 for another service you can configure the MCP to use a different port.

Claude Code example:
`claude mcp add mindpilot -- npx @mindpilot/mcp@latest --port 5555`

### Custom Data Path
To save diagrams to a custom location (e.g., for syncing with cloud storage):

Claude Code example:
`claude mcp add mindpilot -- npx @mindpilot/mcp@latest --data-path /path/to/custom/location`

Other IDEs:
```json
{
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["@mindpilot/mcp@latest", "--data-path", "/path/to/custom/location"]
}
```

### asdf Issues
If you use `asdf` as a version manager and have trouble getting MCPs to work (not just mindpilot), you may need to set a "global" nodejs version from your home directory.

```
cd
asdf set nodejs x.x.x
```

## Development Configuration
Configure the MCP in your coding agent (using `claude` in this example)

`claude mcp add mindpilot -- npx tsx <path to...>/src/server/server.ts`

Run `claude` with the `--debug` flag if you need to see MCP errors

Start the development client (Vite) to get hot module reloading while developing.

`npm run dev`

Open the development client
`localhost:5173`
